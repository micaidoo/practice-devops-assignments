            - **download the jenkins gpg key file from ` https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key` and save it in the `/usr/share/keyrings/` directory as `jenkins-keyring.asc`**

            - **add the jenkins repository `https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable` to the `apt` configuration and use the gpg key you configured earlier `/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc` for package verification**
            ```
            sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
